 * App - Particle System Only
 * 
 * This version runs only the particle system example without navigation.
 * 
 * To use this version:
 * 1. In main.jsx, change: import App from './App-ParticleSystem'
 * 2. Or rename this file to App.jsx (backup the original first)
 * 
 * This is useful when you want to focus on a single scene without
 * the navigation UI and info panels.
