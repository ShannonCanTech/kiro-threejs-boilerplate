 * App - Rotating Cube Only
 * 
 * This version runs only the rotating cube example without navigation.
 * 
 * To use this version:
 * 1. In main.jsx, change: import App from './App-RotatingCube'
 * 2. Or rename this file to App.jsx (backup the original first)
 * 
 * This is useful when you want to focus on a single scene without
 * the navigation UI and info panels.
